## Problem Statement:
### X Education is an online course provider catering to industry professionals. Each day, numerous professionals visit the company's website, exploring various courses. The company promotes its courses through different websites and search engines like Google. When visitors arrive on the site, they may browse courses, complete forms with their contact information, or watch videos. Those who provide their email address or phone number through a form are classified as leads. Additionally, leads are acquired through referrals from previous clients. Once leads are captured, the sales team initiates follow-ups through calls, emails, etc. Some of these leads eventually convert into customers, though the typical conversion rate at X Education is around 30%.
### Goal:
The primary objective is to identify key features that can predict lead conversion. Additionally, generating a Lead Score for all leads will help prioritize those with higher scores, leading to an improved lead conversion rate.
